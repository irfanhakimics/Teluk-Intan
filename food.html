                    <h2>Teluk Intan's Chee Cheong Fun is different from traditional Chee Cheong Fun in a number of ways</h2>
                    <h2>1. Filling: Unlike the Hong Kong-style Chee Cheong Fun, which typically has shrimp or beef fillings, Teluk Intan Chee Cheong Fun often contains preserved turnip (chai poh), dried shrimp, and sometimes minced pork. The filling is savory and adds a distinct flavor to the dish.</h2>
                    <h2>2. No Sauce: One of the unique aspects of Teluk Intan Chee Cheong Fun is that it is usually served without the sweet or savory sauces that accompany other Chee Cheong Fun varieties. Instead, it relies on the flavors of the filling and sometimes a light drizzle of oil for taste.</h2>
                    <h2>The most popular Chee Cheong Fun restaurant in Teluk Intan is Liew Kee Chee Cheong Fun, which is considered the best and has been featured in multiple blogs as a tourist spot</h2>
